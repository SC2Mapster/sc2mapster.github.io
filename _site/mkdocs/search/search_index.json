You may think that your workflow is superior, or that you - personally - work faster or \"better\" in whatever development environment you are currently using. You are - put simply - wrong. The main purpose of this site is to enlighten you, help you, and guide you in how to set up your development environment for Starcraft II modding in the most efficient way we know how. This guide works for both Windows and Linux development. Some advanced tools in other sections of the guide may use or refer to some command line tools that may require additional setup on Windows. But the Getting Started section is universal for both. For Mac users, things might be different. I don't care about you. If you care, you are welcome to contribute to the guide to make it usable for Mac. Nomenclature \u00b6 The following terms may or may not be written as for example; sc2edit, \"sc2edit\", or sc2edit , depending on who writes the specific part of the documentation. sc2edit refers to the Starcraft II Editor, no particular part of it Data Editor or Data module refers to the part of sc2edit that deals with the Data, accessible by the default shortcut F7 from sc2edit Trigger Editor or Trigger module refers to the part of sc2edit that deals with Triggers, accessible by the default shortcut F6 from sc2edit UI Editor or UI module refers to the part of sc2edit that deals with UI editing. You will never use it. And so forth. Keybindings / Shortcuts \u00b6 Hotkeys/Keyboard shortcuts on this site are referred to by their shorthand. Mac users figure it out on your own. There are a few key bindings in the SC2 client that are exceptionally useful for user interface development - the binding for showing the interface inspector, and the binding for reloading the interface from disk. XXX: I have rebound both from the standard bindings, and would rather type out this sentence than do a simple discord search or start SC2 to find the standard bindings. Which means someone else should enter them and remove this notice. For example, c-s-a-P is Ctrl+Shift+Alt+P , c-s-F is Ctrl+Shift+F , and c-P is simply Ctrl+P . Lowercased letters c , s , and a , refer to the modifier keys Ctrl , Shift , and Alt . Tab has no shorthand. A shortcut listed as c-K-O means \"While holding down Ctrl , hit K followed by O \". Though shortcut keys are listed as uppercase, you should not hold down Shift or enable Caps Lock . It is just a way of distinguishing them from the modifier keys. SC2Components \u00b6 SC2Components and SC2Map are two sides of the same coin. SC2Map is, in laymans terms, a ZIP-file containing all the files that go into making a SC2 map. SC2Components is simply the unzipped version - again, in laymans terms. If the above paragraph made sense to you, that's really all there is to it. There is no magic otherwise. Some people in the community are under the impression that one is different to the other in weird ways that noone can comprehend. This is utter nonsense. The difference is archived vs not archived. When you click File - Save As in sc2edit , you are presented with the option of saving as .SC2Components . Always do this. A note on publishing When you are ready to publish your map to Battle.net, it does not let you publish unarchived projects. At this point, you simply save your project as an .SC2Map or whatever type is relevant to your project, then publish, and then close the map again. This is the only inconvenience from working unarchived, and frankly it means nothing. Step 1: Editor setup \u00b6 Start sc2edit Open the File menu and select Preferences... (default hotkey c-s-a-P ) Select Documents in the left-hand list Untick the checkbox called Automatically Reload Documents On External File Change Untick the checkbox called Remember Extra Data Loaded With Documents Select General in the left-hand list Tick the checkbox called Disable Visual Styles Tick the checkbox called Disable Live Resize Select Test Document in the left-hand list Tick the checkbox called Show Trigger Debugging Window Tick the checkbox called Break On Trigger Error (If Debug Window Is open) Some other options you might want to set are Startup/Startup Windows to Specific Modules: Triggers Startup/Startup Documents to None Documents/Optimize Saving For to Smaller Files Disable the Blizzard/Obfuscate Script Files When Publishing Locked Maps (more about this in the section Security and Banks ) Step 1.5: Open your existing sc2edit project \u00b6 If you have no existing project (so you're reading this guide before venturing forth on your first SC2 project), then you do this step later. If your project has already been saved as a .SC2Components folder, then you've already done this step. To get access to the raw files that are by default archived into the .SC2Map file, you need to save your project manually as an \"unzipped\", or non-archived folder. Open your project in sc2edit Hit File - Save As Select Starcraft II Component Folders (.SC2Components) in the Files of type: dropdown at the bottom Navigate to your Projects folder. Note that you can NOT save as .SC2Components in the same folder that contains your existing map of the same name. Just simply save it in a different folder. The \"file name\" can remain as mymap.SC2Map ( sc2edit will add \".SC2Map\" behind the name even if you remove it) Hit Save sc2edit is now live with the new SC2Components unarchived version of your map. Open up your file manager in whatever operating system you are using and navigate there. You should have a folder which contains a whole slew of files, that looks something like this: There's a whole lot of files there, some of which we do not care about, and it might look confusing to you at the moment. Don't worry about it. You can now, in fact, delete your old .SC2Map file, if you have one. You will not use it again. Step 2: Visual Studio Code \u00b6 Though Microsoft has always - rightfully - been a despised company, one of their more recent endeavours has resulted in a product called vscode . This editor is simply the best all-round editor on the market, and anyone who claims otherwise has no idea what they're talking about. There are better alternatives for individual languages, like Java, C#, Javascript, and so forth - but as a general purpose development environment, it has no equal or better. Visual Studio Code will be referred to as simply vscode , or vscode, throughout this site. 2.1: Download vscode \u00b6 Download vscode from https://code.visualstudio.com/ and run the installer, then continue to the next section. Alternatively, if you want to live more on the edge and use their development version, get vscode-insiders, from https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/ . The Insiders build is over 99% stable for daily use. It fails occasionally, but at those times you can simply download the previous days build and reinstall that. There are even more bleeding-edge versions of vscode, including building it yourself, or their \"Explorers\" edition. These are not recommended for normal use. 2.2: Start vscode \u00b6 Upon your first launch of vscode , it may look daunting. But not to worry. Hit c-P to open vscode \"quick open\" Enter (or copy+paste) ext install talv.sc2galaxy , and hit Enter Open c-P again, enter ext install talv.sc2layouts , and hit Enter Open c-P again, enter ext install alefragnani.project-manager , and hit Enter Open c-P again, enter ext install azemoh.one-monokai , and hit Enter Restart vscode Hit c-K-T (read the Keybindings / Shortcuts section above if you don't understand) and select the \"One Monokai\" theme (or whatever theme fits your fancy, obviously) 2.3: Configure vscode \u00b6 Hit c-s-P and type in sett , find the Preferences: Open Settings (JSON) item and hit Enter . There are a bunch of settings you may or may not want to tweak in vscode. The default settings are OK, but the workspace is fairly cluttered by default. To tweak an individual setting, hover your mouse over it on the left-hand side of the split and notice that a pencil icon shows up on the far left. Click the pencil to add the setting to \"your\" side - the right side. It can be easy to get overwhelmed here. Take your time and get familiar with things. VScode nowadays also has an UI version of their settings, which this author has never used. You are, of course, welcome to explore that as well - though it presents nothing new, it just presents it differently. VSCode Settings 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 // Place your settings in this file to overwrite the default settings { \"editor.fontFamily\" : \"Hasklig\" , \"editor.fontSize\" : 14 , \"editor.insertSpaces\" : false , \"editor.roundedSelection\" : false , \"editor.mouseWheelZoom\" : true , \"editor.fontLigatures\" : true , \"editor.hideCursorInOverviewRuler\" : true , \"editor.renderIndentGuides\" : true , \"editor.folding\" : false , \"editor.renderWhitespace\" : \"boundary\" , \"editor.renderControlCharacters\" : true , \"workbench.editor.showIcons\" : false , \"files.trimTrailingWhitespace\" : false , \"explorer.openEditors.visible\" : 0 , \"explorer.autoReveal\" : false , \"explorer.enableDragAndDrop\" : false , \"update.channel\" : \"default\" , \"extensions.autoUpdate\" : true , \"files.associations\" : { \"*.StormLayout\" : \"sc2layout\" , \"*.stormlayout\" : \"sc2layout\" , \"release\" : \"lua\" , \"stlrel\" : \"lua\" , \"linkstl\" : \"lua\" , }, \"window.zoomLevel\" : 0 , \"files.insertFinalNewline\" : true , \"editor.wordWrap\" : \"off\" , \"workbench.colorTheme\" : \"One Monokai\" , \"workbench.iconTheme\" : \"material-icon-theme\" , \"editor.acceptSuggestionOnCommitCharacter\" : false , \"editor.overviewRulerBorder\" : false , \"editor.cursorBlinking\" : \"phase\" , \"editor.glyphMargin\" : false , \"window.title\" : \"${dirty}${rootName}\" , \"files.hotExit\" : \"onExitAndWindowClose\" , \"window.restoreFullscreen\" : true , \"editor.formatOnPaste\" : false , \"workbench.activityBar.visible\" : true , \"editor.minimap.enabled\" : true , \"window.restoreWindows\" : \"all\" , \"workbench.startupEditor\" : \"newUntitledFile\" , \"extensions.ignoreRecommendations\" : true , \"sc2galaxy.completion.functionExpand\" : \"ArgumentsDefault\" , \"window.menuBarVisibility\" : \"visible\" , \"editor.snippetSuggestions\" : \"none\" , \"editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions\" : false , \"files.autoSave\" : \"off\" , \"sc2layout.builtinMods\" : { \"mods/core.sc2mod\" : true , \"mods/war3data.sc2mod\" : false , \"mods/novastoryassets.sc2mod\" : false , \"mods/voidprologue.sc2mod\" : false , \"mods/alliedcommanders.sc2mod\" : false , \"mods/missionpacks/novacampaign.sc2mod\" : false , \"campaigns/liberty.sc2campaign\" : true , \"campaigns/swarm.sc2campaign\" : true , \"campaigns/swarmstory.sc2campaign\" : false , \"campaigns/void.sc2campaign\" : false , \"campaigns/voidstory.sc2campaign\" : false }, \"extensions.showRecommendationsOnlyOnDemand\" : true , \"window.titleBarStyle\" : \"custom\" } Great fonts for coding It is advisable to use http://app.programmingfonts.org/ to find a monospaced font that suits your style. Common and popular fonts include Fira Code , Hasklig , Plex Mono , and Source Code Pro . This website uses Plex Mono for monospaced code blocks like the JSON settings above. After installing a custom font, you may be required to restart VSCode before you can select it in the settings. 2.4: Open your project \u00b6 At this point, if you have not yet started your project in sc2edit , it is time to do so. Once you've done that, save the empty map as an .SC2Components map in sc2edit, and come back to vscode . Hit c-K-O , navigate to the root folder of your SC2 project, and open it. vscode should look something like this: Hit c-s-P , type pms and hit Enter . Enter a project name, like \"My SC2 Map\", and hit Enter . Your map is now saved as a project. Now, download the SC2+Storm game data (alternatively, use some git tool to clone the repository ), and unzip it somewhere (not in your map folder) Back to vscode, then hit c-s-N to open a new window, then c-K-O , navigate to the root folder of the unzipped gamedata from the previous step, and open it in this new window. Hit c-s-P , type pms and hit Enter . Enter a project name, like \"SC2 Game Data\" (it also contains the game data for Heroes of the Storm), and hit Enter . The SC2+Storm game data is now saved as a project. Now, you should have two vscode windows floating on your desktop. One window should contain the code for your SC2 project, and the other window should contain the code for SC2 and Heroes of the Storm. Obviously, you will be working in the first one. The SC2 gamedata project contains all the interface, map code, and backend data for all of SC2 and Storm. Including the Battle.net interface (not the desktop launcher, but the ingame menus). All of it. This is now your reference. It is your bible. This is where you search for answers when you don't know how something works. Step 3: Initializing sc2edit \u00b6 Now it's time to set up the files and folders to work from and in. This can be a bit tedious, but you only need to do it once. 3.1: Initialize Font Styles \u00b6 The first step, unless your SC2 project already contains modified Font Styles, is to create the Font Styles file and system. Unless you do this from sc2edit first, it will complain later. If your map already contains changes to Font Styles, you do not need to perform this step. Tab to sc2edit, where your project should already be open Hit F8 to open the Text module (menu Modules - Text ) Change to the Font Styles tab Right-click in the left side of the window, select the Add Style... menu item Insert any name, like lolplzblizz , and set any template on it, and hit OK Hit c-S to save the project Close the Text module You will never open the Text module again. They say there are no rules without exceptions, but they are mistaken. There is no need to ever open the Text module again. Blizzard themselves do not use the Text module. You can use the Text module, it is just a less efficient method of accomplishing your work. 3.2: Initialize UI XML \u00b6 The second step is to initialize what sc2edit calls the DescIndex and related user interface XML files. If your map already contains changes to the DescIndex, you do not need to perform this step. Hit s-F6 to open the UI module (menu Modules - UI ) Right-click anywhere in the left side of the window, select the Add Layout... ( NOT Add Frame... ) menu item Insert any name, like wtfbbq , and hit OK Hit c-S to save the project Close the UI module And just like with the Text module, the UI module will never again be opened as long as you work on your SC2 project. For eternity, or until Blizzard patches it to be useful. Which they will never do. Blizzard themselves do not use the UI module. 3.3: Initialize the Data \u00b6 Thirdly, you need to make any change to the Data, to initialize the folders and setup on the file side. If your map already contains changes to the Data, you do not need to perform this step. Hit F7 to open the Data module (menu Modules - Data ) Open any tab, it doesn't matter which; Units, Effects, Behaviors, Abilities, anything Select any data entry on the left hand side Remember which tab and entry you modified, so you can revert it later. Change any field on the right hand side from its default value to some other value Hit c-S to save the project Close the Data module 98% or more of your Data work will be done in sc2edits Data module. There are only a few exceptions where it makes sense to edit Data externally. Step 4: Scaffolding your project \u00b6 First of all, save any pending changes and close the project in sc2edit for now. There is no need to close the entire editor, just your project. The time has come to fill out the project with some templates, scaffolding, and best practices that you can use and learn from later. The end result will look something like this: 4.1: Base.SC2Data/GameData \u00b6 In the example screenshot above, you can see there is a file called AbilData.xml . Ignore this file, it just means that for step 3.3 above, we changed a random thing in an Ability to get the data initialized. The rest of the folders below GameData are example names. These are categories for your \"Data spaces\". A dataspace is a kind of virtual category where you can put any arbitrary data. If you are not familiar with editing Data yet, do not worry too much about this. There are just a few important things to note: You do not need to create any of them They can be named anything you want It's generally a good idea to prefix the actual dataspace files in each folder with a unique character from A-Z (for sorting purposes in the Data editor) You can have as many, or as few, as you want - and any folder can contain as many as you want They do not need to be in a folder, but can be directly in GameData - see the example file in the screenshot; Auras.xml To be able to use these custom categories / data spaces, you need to add them manually to the file lower down in the screenshot called GameData.xml Dataspaces can be opened as tabs in the Data module, or you can simply use them for sorting the data more easily in an existing core space This is what Base.SC2Data/GameData.xml looks like for our example map (note that it does not contain any references to AbilData.xml , but only to our custom dataspaces): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"us-ascii\"?> <Includes> <!-- ! IMPORTANT NOTE ! You can _NOT_ modify this file while your project is open in sc2edit. Even if the Data editor is closed. The reason this is important to note and remember, is that the same is not true for scripts or layouts. They can be modified, added, removed, etc, however you please while the editor is running. You need to: 1. Close your project in sc2edit 2. Open this file and change it 3. Make the necessary changes to the files in GameData/ 4. If you add new files, you need to add the standard <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"us-ascii\"?> <Catalog> </Catalog> (and remember to save as UTF8 with LF line endings.) 5. Make sure you save everything, and that all filenames match 6. Close this file and then reopen your project in sc2edit --> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Auras.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Heroes/H-Tychus.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Heroes/H-Alarak.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Heroes/H-Nova.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Talents/T-Tychus.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Zerg/Z-Monster.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Specialists/S-Raynor.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/GameMode/G-MyFunGame.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Evil/E-Nemesis.xml\" /> </Includes> As the comment in the file clearly notes, new files that you add need to be populated with the following code before you open the project in sc2edit again: 1 2 3 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"us-ascii\"?> <Catalog> </Catalog> (you could use the XML shorthand <Catalog/> as well, but you can't paste code from other maps or sources into that, so it's easier with the full open+close tag) You need to save these files as UTF8 (which should be the default in vscode), and with LF line endings. This includes GameData.xml as well. Blizzard themselves use these custom dataspaces for all Heroes of the Storm heroes, and recently (as of writing, with the Tychus Coop commander) they started using it for SC2 Coop data. To complete this step, obviously create as many or as few of the dataspaces you want, and edit GameData.xml accordingly. For large maps, this is a great tool to organize your data. Completely unrelated to the above, this folder is also home to a file called Assets.txt . Here is our example content for this file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // This makes all the tooltips use the blue bnet look, regardless of race. // Obviously, here we are overriding asset-references defined in the sc2 core. // Search for these keys (\"UI/StandardGameTooltip\") in the sc2 game data // vscode window (c-s-F) to find out where they are used and defined. UI/StandardGameTooltip = Assets\\Textures\\ui_battlenet_tooltip_outline.dds UI/StandardGameTooltip_Prot = Assets\\Textures\\ui_battlenet_tooltip_outline.dds UI/StandardGameTooltip_Terr = Assets\\Textures\\ui_battlenet_tooltip_outline.dds UI/StandardGameTooltip_Zerg = Assets\\Textures\\ui_battlenet_tooltip_outline.dds All this example properties files does is override the texture used for the ingame tooltip that usually depends on race, to all use the same Battle.net-style texture. In this file, you can add any identifier (the part before = ), and use it to reference any resource (dds, jpeg, png, tga, sounds, etc) that is usable by the engine. These paths are mostly used by the user interface XML - the .SC2Layout files. The ones in the example code above are used by the core game user interface code. Exercise As an exercise, copy UI/StandardGameTooltip to your clipboard now, switch to the vscode instance that is open with the SC2+Storm Game Data, and hit c-s-F . Hit c-V to paste your clipboard, and hit Enter to search the game data for UI/StandardGameTooltip . Look through and find where the property is defined, and where it might be used. See if you can find one or more instances where it is prefixed by @@ . This means that the current players race identifier ( _Terr , _Zerg , _Prot , or custom) will be appended to the property name at lookup. 4.2: Base.SC2Data/UI/Layout \u00b6 As you can see from the screenshot above, we've already deleted the .SC2Layout file we created in step 3.2. Whatever you named it - wtfbbq.SC2Layout , test.SC2Layout , etc - just delete it now. Add in the files as named in the screenshot; Constants , LoadingScreen , Overrides , and Templates - all with the .SC2Layout extension. All .SC2Layout files must be saved as UTF8 with LF line endings to match sc2edit. Obviously, the files - except DescIndex - can be named anything you want. The below are just to get some core concepts into your head along with some comments and frames that might be relevant to the context.

Most of that is done in the Fonts and Styles section. For now, the important thing to do is just get the following code copied and pasted into the file. You can replace the entire file, the font style we created in step 3.1 is obviously not used for anything. This file should be saved as UTF8 with CRLF line endings. In the code, there are some constants pointing to the default Blizzard fonts. These can be replaced with whatever font you want, as long as you package it with your map. The way this FontStyles.SC2Style is set up, no matter what fonts you pick it will work for all languages - they simply fall back to the Blizzard font for Asian glyphs that your weird font doesn't support. Personally, this author places those in a folder called Fonts in the base of the map. In which case, the constant would be, for example <Constant name=\"MyHeaderFont\" val=\"Fonts\\Wingdings.ttf\"/> . The Weird font is not used by any of the standard UI elements - it is just there to show that you can add more than 2 fonts. Obviously, if you do not wish to restyle the entire SC2 interface with your own font choices (but you do, because the Metro font from Heroes of the Storm looks much better), you can simply remove the relevant overrides, FontGroups, and Constants. Go to the Fonts and Styles for more details.

For a large scale map, it will benefit you to write 50% of the code in the Trigger editor, and the other 50% of the code in raw Galaxy. There's a few things that are simply easier to reference in the Trigger editor - like Actors, Cinematics, Map initialization, and so forth. Over time, you will learn which parts are more easily done where. Remember the 50/50 rule - it is quite spot on for this author. Our current project is ~29000 lines of MapScript.galaxy (which is automatically generated by sc2edit from the Triggers), and ~10000 lines of code in raw Galaxy. It may not seem like those numbers add up to 50/50, but once you learn how much \"fluff\" sc2edit produces when auto-generating code, you'll see that it is, in fact, close to 50/50. Galaxy files in this folder can be added/deleted/renamed, and coded on to your hearts content without requiring restarts of sc2edit .

Ignore this file, it just means that for step 3.3 above, we changed a random thing in an Ability to get the data initialized. The rest of the folders below GameData are example names. These are categories for your \"Data spaces\". A dataspace is a kind of virtual category where you can put any arbitrary data. If you are not familiar with editing Data yet, do not worry too much about this. There are just a few important things to note: You do not need to create any of them They can be named anything you want It's generally a good idea to prefix the actual dataspace files in each folder with a unique character from A-Z (for sorting purposes in the Data editor) You can have as many, or as few, as you want - and any folder can contain as many as you want They do not need to be in a folder, but can be directly in GameData - see the example file in the screenshot; Auras.xml To be able to use these custom categories / data spaces, you need to add them manually to the file lower down in the screenshot called GameData.xml Dataspaces can be opened as tabs in the Data module, or you can simply use them for sorting the data more easily in an existing core space This is what Base.SC2Data/GameData.xml looks like for our example map (note that it does not contain any references to AbilData.xml , but only to our custom dataspaces): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"us-ascii\"?> <Includes> <!-- ! IMPORTANT NOTE ! You can _NOT_ modify this file while your project is open in sc2edit. Even if the Data editor is closed. The reason this is important to note and remember, is that the same is not true for scripts or layouts. They can be modified, added, removed, etc, however you please while the editor is running. You need to: 1. Close your project in sc2edit 2. Open this file and change it 3. Make the necessary changes to the files in GameData/ 4. If you add new files, you need to add the standard <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"us-ascii\"?> <Catalog> </Catalog> (and remember to save as UTF8 with LF line endings.) 5. Make sure you save everything, and that all filenames match 6. Close this file and then reopen your project in sc2edit --> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Auras.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Heroes/H-Tychus.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Heroes/H-Alarak.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Heroes/H-Nova.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Talents/T-Tychus.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Zerg/Z-Monster.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Specialists/S-Raynor.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/GameMode/G-MyFunGame.xml\" /> <Catalog path= \"GameData/Evil/E-Nemesis.xml\" /> </Includes> As the comment in the file clearly notes, new files that you add need to be populated with the following code before you open the project in sc2edit again: 1 2 3 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"us-ascii\"?> <Catalog> </Catalog> (you could use the XML shorthand <Catalog/> as well, but you can't paste code from other maps or sources into that, so it's easier with the full open+close tag) You need to save these files as UTF8 (which should be the default in vscode), and with LF line endings. This includes GameData.xml as well. Blizzard themselves use these custom dataspaces for all Heroes of the Storm heroes, and recently (as of writing, with the Tychus Coop commander) they started using it for SC2 Coop data. To complete this step, obviously create as many or as few of the dataspaces you want, and edit GameData.xml accordingly. For large maps, this is a great tool to organize your data. Completely unrelated to the above, this folder is also home to a file called Assets.txt . Here is our example content for this file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // This makes all the tooltips use the blue bnet look, regardless of race. // Obviously, here we are overriding asset-references defined in the sc2 core. // Search for these keys (\"UI/StandardGameTooltip\") in the sc2 game data // vscode window (c-s-F) to find out where they are used and defined.

In this file, you can add any identifier (the part before = ), and use it to reference any resource (dds, jpeg, png, tga, sounds, etc) that is usable by the engine. These paths are mostly used by the user interface XML - the .SC2Layout files. The ones in the example code above are used by the core game user interface code. Exercise As an exercise, copy UI/StandardGameTooltip to your clipboard now, switch to the vscode instance that is open with the SC2+Storm Game Data, and hit c-s-F .

There is a lot to say and write about these. Most of that is done in the Fonts and Styles section. For now, the important thing to do is just get the following code copied and pasted into the file. You can replace the entire file, the font style we created in step 3.1 is obviously not used for anything. This file should be saved as UTF8 with CRLF line endings. In the code, there are some constants pointing to the default Blizzard fonts. These can be replaced with whatever font you want, as long as you package it with your map. The way this FontStyles.SC2Style is set up, no matter what fonts you pick it will work for all languages - they simply fall back to the Blizzard font for Asian glyphs that your weird font doesn't support. Personally, this author places those in a folder called Fonts in the base of the map. In which case, the constant would be, for example <Constant name=\"MyHeaderFont\" val=\"Fonts\\Wingdings.ttf\"/> . The Weird font is not used by any of the standard UI elements - it is just there to show that you can add more than 2 fonts. Obviously, if you do not wish to restyle the entire SC2 interface with your own font choices (but you do, because the Metro font from Heroes of the Storm looks much better), you can simply remove the relevant overrides, FontGroups, and Constants.

For a large scale map, it will benefit you to write 50% of the code in the Trigger editor, and the other 50% of the code in raw Galaxy.

Over time, you will learn which parts are more easily done where. Remember the 50/50 rule - it is quite spot on for this author. Our current project is ~29000 lines of MapScript.galaxy (which is automatically generated by sc2edit from the Triggers), and ~10000 lines of code in raw Galaxy. It may not seem like those numbers add up to 50/50, but once you learn how much \"fluff\" sc2edit produces when auto-generating code, you'll see that it is, in fact, close to 50/50.
