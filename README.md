# Welcome to the SC2Mapster Community Github Site

This site provides some in-depth guides for map and mode developments on Starcraft II. Most of the guides here elaborate on working with the plain text data formats used by Starcraft II, along with some other complex parts of the Galaxy Editor. The tools and references here ease the developments.

Drop a line over the [Issues](https://github.com/SC2Mapster/sc2mapster.github.io/issues) section if you intend to contribute. Then we either add you to the team or include your guides with full credit.
